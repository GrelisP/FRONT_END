	WORK APPROACH:

	• We will set clear goals and maintain consistant work pace- postponing is not an option. Responsible time managment is crutial to 	   achive our goals. 
	• Face to face communication is prefered, but as a backup we can use online communication. 
	• Comumnicate and collaborate - let other team members know what you are working on, any 
	  issues you are encountering. Be honest to say what is on your mind.
	• Live meetings to code and discuss as well as video chats, frequency will depend on the need and availability.
	• We will use Google Drive as an additional option of storage for various material (books, articles, example code of some sorts, 
	  etc.). Furthermore, our facebook group (or another platform we move to) will also serve the purpose of platform for sharing 		various open source material (such as
	  links for articles or videos on the web).
	

	TEAM VALUES:

	• Unity. Team is as strong as it's weakest member. We will learn together and from each other, we will go the extra mile for each 	  other- working in this maner we will generate best posible solutions to challenges we're facing at the time.
	• Fun. Journey is more important than the destination. We have fun while coding. We don't take ourselves too seriously. 
	• Commitment. We enjoy our journey and if we stay commited the results will come naturally.
	• Respectfulness. Respect the opinion of each other, we can make sense out of nonsense.
	• Humility. We are all new to the world of coding and thus we will not insult, belittle or otherwise discomfort each other over
	  a lack of competence we may display.
