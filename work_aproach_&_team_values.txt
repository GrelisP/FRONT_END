	TEAM ONE CODE	 

	WORK APPROACH:

	• Team is as strong as it's weakest member. 
	• Face to face communication is prefered, but as a backup we can use our facebook group. (Titas)
	• Comumnicate and collaborate - let other team members know what you are working on, about any 
	  issues you are encountering. we honest to say that on your mind, but - to use tact. (Aurimas) 
	• One hour meeting with a cup of coffee atfer each weekend classes, and 30 minutes group video 
	  chat during the evenings of working days (Shina)
	• We will use Google Drive as an additional option of storage for various material (books, articles, example code of some sorts, 
	  etc.). Furthermore, our facebook group will also serve the purpose of platform for sharing various open source material (such as
	  links for articles or videos on the web). (Aleksas)
	

	TEAM VALUES:

	• Support and Help to each other. It is allways a good practice while learning to go an extra mile for a team mate.
	• Journey is more important than the destination. (Titas)
	• Team succeed and fail together. (Aurimas)
	• Respect the opinion of each other, we can make sense out of nonsense (Shina) 
	• Humility. We are all new to the world of coding and thus we will not insult, belittle or otherwise discomfort each other over
	  a lack of competence we may display. (Aleksas)
