					<strong>Reg tech</strong>
					<span id="author">	
						By <span id="author-name"> Titas Aleksandravicius</span> - financial reporting enthusiast on March 21, 2017.

					What is regulatory technology or better knows as Regtech and why it has
					great potential? To better understand it, we need to look at the reasons
					and context which lead to the growth of Regtech. Firstly after the 2008
					financial crisis, people and politicialns were not happy with the performance
					of the financial sector. This lead to an increase of regulation. Secondly,
					there is a growth of fintech companies which put presure on the brick
					and mortart companies of the financial sector. One of the competiteve
					advantages of the fintech is the create financial products with the
					newest techologies and offer better deals.
					<span>
						Regulatory technology better knows as "RegTech" is a new growing field that uses
						information technology to improve the regulatory reporting and financial regulations.
						If you would spend more than one day working in the financial industry,
						it would appear that Exel is the solution to all data related problems. It comes as no
						surprise, that RegTech has a great potential to improve the regulatory reporting processes and replace Excel. Regulatory technology solutions puts the emphasis on digitalization of manual reporting and improvement on the financial regulations.
					</span>
					As an external pressure factor after the 2008 financial crisis, financial sector was forced by governments around the world to increase the transparency levels dramatically. It comes as no surprise that regulations will only increase in the future. General Data Protection Regulation or better known as GDPR is the latest challenge. Why it is a challenge? Because the main goal of the GDPR is the data protection of the citizens of Europe and companies like banks or credit score agencies potentially has access to out most sensitive information. The challenges comes when companies in the finance industries are under pressure of the newest regulations on detail reporting. It comes as no surprise that the detail reporting might require access to sensitive information to build. The nightmarish scenario becomes a reality when an office worker whose primary tool is excel will access our sensitive information like daily transaction in order to build a report for the regulatory agency. There is a million and a one way this could lead to a data privacy breach. One of the solutions might be a new RegTech technology which will automatically build the report and send it to the regulatory agencies. This solution not only reduces the data breach possibilities but also eliminated the manual work of the office worker which leads to the to cost savings and higher levels of quality in the long-term.

					<strong>CRYPTO-CURRENCY</strong>
					<span id="author">	
						By <span id="author-name"> ADESHINA HAMZAT</span> - Game Over For Bitcoin August 11, 2018.
					</span>
					<img src="game-over.jpg" alt="game-over"/>	
					Just as bitcoin was starting to look better and trading above $8,000, prices are down again and technical analysts are warning that there could be more trouble ahead for the popular cryptocurrency. Despite positive news this week that Goldman Sachs Group is looking into offering custody for crypto funds, bitcoin prices tumbled after topping $8,000 in July, disappointing crypto bulls who were hoping for a major rally this summer.
					<span></span>
					<span>
						According to Renaissance Macro Research, what bitcoin is facing right now could be much more significant than just a brief bear run or a retracement. The cryptocurrency could in fact be facing a huge crisis, with its key year-to-date support level being the buffer between the currency and more substantial damage. Break that level, says Renaissance Macro Research, and bitcoin will be <q>permanently impaired</q>.
					</span>
					<span></span>
					<span>
						After a bull run took it well above $8,000, bitcoin has sunk back below $7,000, and its current price is roughly 14 percent down at the same time a week ago. On Wednesday August 7, it lost about 6 percent of its value on news that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed a long-awaited decision on a proposed bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).
					</span>
					<span></span>
					<span>
						This, however, could just be the tip of the pain iceberg for investors according to Renaissance head of technical research Jeff deGraaf. <q>Parabolic moves are notoriously dangerous for short-sellers … Usually a top develops that often appears as a descending triangle over months, with reduced volatility and little (fanfare)</q>, Renaissance Macro Research technical research head Jeff deGraaf said in a note to clients on Thursday. <q>Once the top is complete on the support violation, the security in question can often be considered permanently impaired or even 'game-over'.</q>
					</span>
					<span></span>
					<span>
						DeGraaf’s words will come as bad news for cryptocurrency investors because he is a personality that markets generally tend to take note of when he speaks. As one of Wall Street’s best regarded forecasters since the turn of the millennium, deGraaf has been recognised severally for accurate predictions and peerless analysis. For a total of 10 years, he has been ranked as top technical analyst by Investor Magazine, and in 2014 he was inducted into the Institutional Investor’s Research Hall of Fame.
					</span>
					<span></span>
					<span>
						What all of this potentially means to an investor is that one of Wall Street’s finest analysts has painted a scenario where bitcoin — down about 50 percent in 2018 — is not going on a bear run it will recover from, but is rather drifting toward a position of permanent asset damage.

					<strong>Technological Singularity</strong>
					<span id="author">	
						By <span id="author-name"> AURIMAS TIJUNONIS</span> - TITLE AND DATE.

					An analysis of technology history shows that technological changes are exponential rather than linear. In other words, in the 21st century, we will not have 100 years of progress, which will be more than 2000 years of progress. As we expected, in the near future, computer intelligence, or AI intelligence, will exceed human intelligence, the Singularity will take place - technological changes so quickly and deeply that will change human history. Our parents hoped that the future would be almost the same as theirs, similar to the past. When people think about the future, they think that the current level of progress will continue for future periods. However, a serious assessment of technology history suggests that technological change is exponential. Exponential growth is a feature of any evolutionary process, the main example of which is technology.
					<span>
					If we apply these principles at the level of Earth's evolution, the formation of cells has begun a biology paradigm. For the first steps, evolution required billions of years, and then progress accelerated. During the evolutionary explosion, the main paradigm shifts took only tens of millions of years. Later humanoids evolved over millions of years, and then Homo sapiens stumbled for hundreds of thousands of years. And the exponential velocity became too fast for the evolution of DNA-directed protein synthesis and then moved to human-made technology.
					</span>
					The first technological steps - fire, wheel, took tens of thousands of years. For people living in this era, even technological changes have been observed for thousands of years. Then in the first twenty years of the 20th century we have seen more progress than during the nineteenth century. Now changes in the paradigm take place only in a few years. The Internet did not exist only decades ago. Thus, technological advances in the twenty-first century will be equivalent to those of about 200 centuries. In the 21st century, we will see thousands of times more technological changes than in all previous ages. This is the nature of exponential growth. While technology is growing exponentially, people live in a linear world. So it seems that technology is coming from nowhere. But, in the end, progress will be so fast that our ability to follow it will simply disappear. It will simply affect our perception of the world. People will change their thought processes and will be able to think even faster. When scientists, with the help of AI, become a million times more intelligent and will work a million times faster, an hour's progress will go up year. In other words, we will become vastly smarter as we merge with our technology. This is then Singularity.
